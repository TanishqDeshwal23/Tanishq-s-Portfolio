        <p class="salutation">Dear MeetMux Hiring Team,</p>

        <div class="body-text">
            <p>
                I am writing to express my keen interest in the Product Developer Intern position at MeetMux, which I discovered on LinkedIn. As a motivated Computer Science undergraduate with hands-on experience in front-end development and real-time systems, I am confident that my skills and passion for building innovative applications align perfectly with your team's goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                My technical foundation is built on a strong proficiency in JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, HTML, and CSS. I have applied these skills in practical settings, most recently during my internship at the Defense Electronics Applications Laboratory (DRDO). There, I gained valuable experience in building real-time systems, developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and understanding client-server communication. This experience has honed my ability to tackle complex technical challenges and contribute effectively to a development team.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my internship experience, I have independently developed projects that showcase my product development capabilities. For example, I built a dynamic Weather App by integrating the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display real-time data, demonstrating my ability to work with external services. I also created an interactive "Whack-A-Mole" game, which sharpened my skills in core JavaScript logic and responsive user interface design. These projects reflect my proactive approach to learning and my dedication to creating functional and engaging user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am particularly drawn to MeetMux because of your commitment to enhancing remote collaboration through intuitive and user-centric product design. The opportunity to contribute to a product that is shaping the future of communication is incredibly exciting, and I am eager to bring my problem-solving abilities and enthusiasm for learning to your team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for considering my application. My resume is attached for your review, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to MeetMux's success.
            </p>
